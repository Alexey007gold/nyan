+ update time zone to my europe
+ add my followed channels
- remove 'ru' language specifics

- can we improve efficiency by not processing already processed docs
    - maybe it's already done when mongo is used and processed docs are stored there

+ check why images are not posted for clusters with several docs
    check 400 response for caption length


ISSUES
- message is sent multiple times (for every identified 'issue')

issue is identified from `channel.json` config file
    also issue is added from detected category
main issue is always assigned
    so every message will go into main issue, but also can be added to some others based on detected category
